# VoIPcord

Advanced Discord bot for VoIP telephony. Add some spice to your inclusive ~~racist~~ shitposting server by allow crank-calling!

Audio works sorta its quiet on the receiving end (the guy on the phone) and you have ~2-4 sec of latency on both ends.

Once I can improve the error handling so this thing doesnt fatally crash (requiring me to wait for the VoIP registration to expire) I'll look into improving it.
